# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on clinical data. The goal is to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using classification algorithms.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**, which includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Typical features include:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- And more...

Each instance is labeled as:
- `M`: Malignant
- `B`: Benign

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

The notebook follows a structured ML pipeline:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load the dataset
   - Understand feature distributions
   - Visualize correlations

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Label encoding

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split
   - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning (if applicable)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC curve

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of findings
   - Best performing model
